Project: Parking-Lot
Name: Ankit Kumar Verma

About the Project:
In this project, I created a parking lot in python. It runs on a command prompt based shell. It facilitates the user to create a parking lot with capacity N.
After creating the parking lot, the user can park the car, leave the car and find a car by registration number. In addition to this, it provides you the facility to check the status of parking lot at any time and also you can locate all cars of a particular colour by their slots and registration number.

Commands for each operation:
Create a parking Lot: ‘create_parking_lot 6’
Park a car: ‘park KA-01-HH-1234 White’
Leave a car: ‘leave 4 ‘
To check status of the parking lot: ‘status’
To print registrations of all cars of a particular colour: ‘registration_numbers_for_cars_with_colour White’
To print positions of all cars of a particular colour: ‘slot_numbers_for_cars_with_colour White’
Slot number of a car by registration number: ‘slot_number_for_registration_number MH-04-AY-1111’
